# MOBILE FIRST

i've used Z-index to show the "share Button icon (SBT)" above "icons bar (IB)" and "info bar (IFB)"

to easy set position for "SBT", i've group SBT,IB and INB into a div name "active" and set [position: relative;]

in main.js , i use .toggle() function to control hiden class.

# DESKTOP

i've added to "active" [overflow: visible]

then in IB changed [position: absolute]

adjust position of IB
